# NYC-Taxi-Analysis
Exploratory and Predictive analysis on NYC taxi data

Here, we are going to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization for which we will prefer seaborn and will train Random Forest, XGBoost & LGBM models then will compare and apply GridSearchCV parameter selection on the better one to check if it does any more improvement and at last will ensemble best predictions.

Thanks to kagglers, I am going through many splendid kernels and learning new techniques and approaches and yes this is my first Kaggle competition submission, will be glad to have your suggestions :)
